I'm off [textdrive](http://textdrive.com/). `173.234.143.161`,
`trutch.textdrive.us` will soon be no more.

I got on with textdrive in 2004. It had a few difficulties along the
way, apexing last year.  Things were looking resolved until two weeks
ago. When suddenly they weren't.

I've been meaning to write my ode for a while. The `tl;dr` is that I
paid $200 in high school and it got me 10 years of decent web hosting.
More importantly, we who got in on the deal early snowballed into an
excited community for a while. A lot of what I'm doing now is because of
this whole thing. It's a shame to see it dispersed, probably now for
good.

Tally ho.
