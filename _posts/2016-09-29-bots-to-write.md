(Image these are tweets, that's where I thought them up.)

two bots I need to write: (1/3)

1. an email autoreply to bother all emailers who have an email signature without preceeding sigdashes (2/3)

2. one to put all the books recommended in http://tinyletter.com/machinesupply/archive onto my library waitlist (2/3)

3. and one to auto-post extended twitter threads from plain text formatted this way (bonus! 4/3)
