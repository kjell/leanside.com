How am I supposed to name `readme` files?  My first inclination is all
lowercase, `.md`.  Most are capitalized. Some are `.markdown`.  I have a
soft spot in my heart for textile, but does anybody use it anymore?

What does everybody else do? Here are the simplest possible statistics I
can grab through github's search. (It doesn't discern upper from lower
case, which is a bummer.)

## {README,Readme,readme}.{md,markdown,textile,â€¦}


| # | extension |
| 7,061,887 | [`md`](https://github.com/search?q=readme+in%3Apath+extension%3Amd&type=Code&ref=searchresults) |
| 386,111 | `markdown` |
| 291,675 | `rdoc` |
| 63,555 | `rst` |
| 37,384 | `textile` |
| 20,999 | `org` |
| 18,532 | `mdown` |
| 3,007 | `pod` |
| 2,263 | `creole` |
| 1,073 | `asciidoc` |
| 1,066 | `mediawiki` |
| 553 | `adoc` |
| 486 | `wiki` |
| 143 | `rest` |
| 54 | `asc` |
| 26 | `lhs` |

`TODO`: how can I search by case? I'd love to know if `README` beats
`Readme` or `readme`.
