Lately I've been enjoying a 'game' with my phone time. It's
simple.

1. Read twitter…
2. until you find something interesting.
3. Shift to that account/person's tweets…
4. read their tweets and favorites
5. GOTO 2

When I first heard of twitter I thought it was stupid. I was wrong! A
few months later [I reconsidered and signed
up](https://discover.twitter.com/first-tweet#kjell_). That was 9 years
ago.

```bash
% t whoami
ID           10090
Since        Oct 22  2006 (9 years ago)
Screen name  @kjell_
Tweets       2,526
Favorites    923
```

My use ebbs and flows. I don't post much, and what I do post in inane.
Right now it's *read-mostly*, the best place to find information. I try
to follow interesting people and occupy their slipstreams through the
web.

per Matt Webb[^1] .

But when there's a tidbit that strikes me, I favorite it. (Tweetbot's
*swipe this box until you see an empty star stage right, then let go* is
perfect.)

Others behave similarly. Those who do leave behind
clear and fascinating slip trails, which my game plays upon to give me a
brief window into a slice of their thinking.
