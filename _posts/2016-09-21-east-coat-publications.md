> I received an unwanted solicitation from the New York Review of Books in the mail. "FOR YOUR USE ONLY - DISCOUNT CODE: DPBJ17T". Please remove my name and address from your mailing list. I would also like to know how you got my contact information, as I haven't authorized any organization to sell my personal info to other advertisers.

In fact, [this article](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/09/29/killer-cats-are-winning/) looks moderately interesting. I'm going to try and read it right now.

I got two magazine subscriptions for christmas this year - *Funny Times*
and *Harpers*. I also enjoyed reading articles from
[Nautilus](http://nautil.us) and bought a subscription while I was in
the mood to support worthwhile media. Around the same time I received
a promotional offer from *The New Yorker* that wasn't quite convincing.

I now receive postal junk mail from publications I would term a mix of
left-leaning, east coast, liberal, and/or "elite". All I'm sure would
catch my eye in any format other than unwanted solicitation. I'm writing
this not to complain, but to showcase of one of my favorite computer
programs (`dotjs`) and think out loud through the idea of filter bubbles
and ad blocking.

# `dotjs`

â€¦is one of my favorite computer things. It allows me a small amount of
control over the internet by reprogramming sites with javascript and css. (["tweak the web"](https://github.com/kjell/.js/commit/04e52f9e5a6e3a5084026292d59f0eeab3a475d9)). It's a browser extension that injects custom javascript (from it's namesake directory, `~/.js`) into any website.

When something on the web bothers me enough, I can spend five odd
minutes and re-program things how I want them to work. Usually this
means deleting ad clutter from a webpage. Or replacing the
facebook newsfeed with choice "inspirational" quotes. Perhaps moulding
things a bit more to my liking.

It's my computer. Even though it's not my internet, because it all
happens on my computer it's within my control to make a few tweaks and
have everything the way I like it.

# Filters, bubbles, ads, and blocking

If only everything worked that way. Junk postal mail, for instance. Even
worthwhile transactional mail. Why can't I program medical bills that
come in the mail with a 'pay now' button? (Because it's real life. I'm
sure there will soon be a virtual-reality enhanced mail opening
experience. And I'm unsure if I will ever want that.)

I don't watch much TV. And when I do consume media I'm empowered in
a similar way to when I web-browse - TV shows download themselves onto
my computer, pre-screened with all advertisements removed (via usenet + sickbeard).
The movies and shows I watch, similar to the books and
websites I read, come from where I already am. Which goes to say
I only see the things I want to see. I read the things I already want
to read. If I don't like something, I go one step further than
ignoring it - I build rules into my system to ensure I won't have to
ever see it again. I change it to work in a way that makes me happy.

As the world continues to consolidate experiences that once happened
in the physical and hard to control world into services that
are delivered wrapped in a veil of digital individuality, what happens
to the social contract that once held us all together? This isn't an
original thought.

# Now for politics - rant warning

[I made a flippant prediction over a year
ago](https://twitter.com/kjell_/status/635404483028062208) - that the
upcoming US presidential election would be decided more than any
previous based on social media. This also isn't a groundbreaking
 statement. It's happening because we've trapped ourselves
within the walls immature tech echo chambers.

But I can't adblock the next president.
